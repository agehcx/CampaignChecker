## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Executable doesn't exist" Error

If you see this error:
```
BrowserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at /path/to/chromium
```

**Solution:** Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

### No Notifications Received

1. Check if `.env` file exists with correct credentials
2. Verify bot token is valid: Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
3. Ensure you've started a chat with your bot
4. Check console output for error messages

### Campaign Not Detected

- The script looks for the Thai text "เร็วๆ นี้" (Coming Soon)
- Binance TH may have changed their HTML structure
- Check the console output for the HTML length to verify it's loading

---

## 🔧 Development

### Running in Debug Mode

View full HTML content:
```python
# In monitor_binance_th.py, add this after fetching HTML:
print(html[:1000])  # Print first 1000 characters
```

### Testing Without Notifications

Comment out the notification calls:
```python
# await notify_telegram(msg)
# await notify_line(msg)
```

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Fetch Page** - Uses Playwright to load the Binance TH campaign page with a real browser
2. **Wait for Content** - Waits for dynamic content to load completely
3. **Parse HTML** - Extracts campaign details using BeautifulSoup
4. **Check Status** - Looks for campaigns with "เร็วๆ นี้" (Coming Soon) status
5. **Send Alerts** - Sends formatted notifications to Telegram with all campaign details
